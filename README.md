# pseudoRandomPolys.js
A quick and dirty way of generating pseudo-random, convex polygons for testing spatial applications.

Considerably faster than angle ordering as in Pavel Valtr's implementation (see “Probability that n random points are in convex position.”), particularly for larger numbers of points per polygon: https://jsben.ch/tBvX5.
